# Timesheet Management System (Version 3)

## Overview
The Timesheet Management System is a comprehensive Streamlit-based application designed for efficient time tracking and project management. It provides a secure platform for employees to log their daily work hours against specific projects and for administrators to oversee operations, manage resources, and generate reports.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with CAPTCHA and automated account lockout after 5 failed attempts.
- **Time Tracking**: Easy-to-use interface for employees to add, edit, and delete daily timesheet entries.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full control over employee and project management, including assignment of projects to specific resources.
- **Reporting**: Detailed project-wise and employee-wise reports with export capabilities.
- **Data Security**: Encryption of sensitive project information and secure password hashing (bcrypt).
- **Timezone Aware**: Standardized UTC-based lockout system for consistent cross-region performance.
